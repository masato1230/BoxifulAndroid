## Boxiful
Boxiful is a web-based, kickboxing game that aims to make it easy and fun for users to exercise at home. Play with punches and kicks in front of the screen. When you punch or kick in front of the screen, AI determines your body movements and gives you feedback.

Kick and punch are judged by analyzing the image acquired from the front camera of the device with the pose estimation AI.

By creating an account, you can record the training performance status and look back on the number of training performances and calories burned. Let's look back on the training record and motivate the exercise!
